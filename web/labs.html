                    I have created some web pages before using HTML/CSS but in general
                    I am still pretty new to web programming.  I have not used
                    javascript or any client-side frameworks before this class.

                    I used compound selectors to style the links in my navbar.  I also
                    used the float rule to move my image on the home page to the right
                    side of the screen.

                    I learned a great deal of css during this lab.  I learned how to
                    position elements on the page.  I also learned the concepts of block
                    elements vs. inline elements.  I also got some experience in using
                    colors to make my website more appealing.
