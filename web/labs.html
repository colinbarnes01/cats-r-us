                <h2>Lab 1</h2>
                <p>
                    I have created some web pages before using HTML/CSS but in general
                    I am still pretty new to web programming.  I have not used
                    javascript or any client-side frameworks before this class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used compound selectors to style the links in my navbar.  I also
                    used the float rule to move my image on the home page to the right
                    side of the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned a great deal of css during this lab.  I learned how to
                    position elements on the page.  I also learned the concepts of block
                    elements vs. inline elements.  I also got some experience in using
                    colors to make my website more appealing.

                <h2>Lab 2: Responsive Design and Single Page Design</h2>
                <p> For this lab I learned how to design a website as a virtul
                    single page.  This means that in essence I have three distinct
                    pages in my website.  However, using some javascript and css
                    I am able to present all these 'pages' in one scrollable webpage.
                </p>
                <p> I also had the opportunity to learn about responsive design.
                    Responsive design means that a website alters its' layout
                    according to the size of the viewing device.  So the same
                    website will look different on a laptop and a mobile phone,
                    for example.  I achieved this by using media queries and the
                    jQuery javascript framework.

                <h2>Lab 3 & 4: Custom JavaScript Animation Framework</h2>
                <p>In this lab I created a custom Javascript framework.  The
                   framework allows a programmer to create and animate cat
                   images. The framework uses sprites and allows the user to
                   animate cats walking around on the screen.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about JavaScript in this lab.  I learned a
                    lot of JS syntax, how JS objects relate to and differ from objects
                    in other languages.  I also learned about frameworks, what
                    they are and how to make my own.
